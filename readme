I wrote this program for my Data Structures and Intro. to Algorithms class. It implements a circular queue to store up to 31 transactions.

Sample input
b 100 200 	<--- buy 100 stocks @ $200 each
s 40 50 	<--- sell 40 stocks @ $50 each
c 			<--- print capital gain
q 			<--- quit

Some bugs I encountered:

How to handle blank or invalid input
Selling when no transactions were stored
Buying when the transaction queue was full
Selling stocks from different days (i.e. selling more stocks than those stored in the first index)
